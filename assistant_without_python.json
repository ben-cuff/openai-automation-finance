What is the interest rate on just $20,000 borrowed that results in a payment of $194.99 for 25 years?**\n\nLet \\( r_x \\) be the monthly interest rate for $20,000 over 25 years (300 payments):\n\n\\[\n194.99 = \\frac{r_x \\times 20000}{1 - (1 + r_x)^{-300}}\n\\]\n\nLet's solve for \\( r_x \\):\n\nThis is a bit tricky algebraically, but commonly people use financial calculators or Excel to solve for rate when given payment, period, and loan.\n\nAlternatively, use the trial-and-error or use the RATE formula in Excel as:\n\n\\[\nRATE(300, -194.99, 20000) = r_x\n\\]\n\nLet\u2019s estimate \\( r_x \\):\n\nLet's try yearly rates:\n\n- At 4.10%, payment would be:\n\n\\[\nPayment = \\frac{0.00341667 \\times 20000}{1 - (1.00341667)^{-300}} = \\frac{68.33}{0.6324} = 108.08\n\\]\n\nBut this is much lower than 194.99, meaning the equivalent interest rate is **much higher**.\n\nLet's try with a much higher rate. Suppose \\( r_x = 0.008 \\) (9.6% per year):\n\n\\[\n(1 + 0.008)^{-300} = (1.008)^{-300} \\approx 0.0836\n\\]\n\\[\n1 - 0.0836 = 0.9164\n\\]\n\\[\n0.008 \\times 20000 = 160\n\\]\n\\[\nP = 160 / 0.9164 = 174.63\n\\]\n\nStill a bit low. Let's go a bit higher. Try \\( r_x = 0.009 \\) (10.8% per year):\n\n\\[\n(1.009)^{-300} \\approx 0.0652\n\\]\n\\[\n1 - 0.0652 = 0.9348\n\\]\n\\[\n0.009 \\times 20000 = 180\n\\]\n\\[\nP = 180 / 0.9348 = 192.54\n\\]\n\nVery close to 194.99. Let's try \\( r_x = 0.00913 \\) (10.956% per year):\n\n\\[\n0.00913 \\times 20000 = 182.6\n\\]\n\\[\n(1.00913)^{-300} \\approx 0.0634\n\\]\n\\[\n1 - 0.0634 = 0.9366\n\\]\n\\[\nP = 182.6 / 0.9366 = 195.01\n\\]\n\nVery close to required payment of 194.99! So, the monthly rate is about 0.913%.\n\nAnnualized: \\( 0.00913 \\times 12 = 0.10956 \\) or 10.956%.\n\nSo, the effective incremental interest rate (cost of borrowing the extra $20k, compared to the blended loan structure) is about 10.96%.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n@@@10.96@@@\n\n**How it was calculated**:  \n- Calculated payment difference between two loans: 194.99 per month.\n- Solved for the annual interest rate that makes a $20,000, 25-year loan have that same payment.\n- Found approximately 10.96% annual rate gives a $20,000, 25-year payment of about 195.",

Thus total is approximately \\(9.5 + 0.259 = 9.76\\%\\).\n\n   So, the effective interest rate on the additional $20,000 borrowed is about **9.8** (rounded to 1 decimal).\n\n   **Summary:** If you want to know the effective (incremental) rate you are paying by borrowing $20,000 more at the higher rate, it's about 9.8%.\n\n   @@@9.8@@@",

Compare Total Payments (as present value)\n\nLet\u2019s assume future values are weighted \"as if they happened today\" (we're discounting to present value, but since both loans are discounted equally, we'll just compare the sum of new payments plus out-of-pocket vs old payments).\n\n#### Remaining Old Loan Payments\n\nYou have 300 payments left at $1326 = 300 \u00d7 1326 = 397800\n\n#### New Loan Payments\n\nYou pay 8418 up front.  \nThen 360 \u00d7 1148 = 413280  \nTotal = 413280 + 8418 = 421698\n\n**But wait**: You only have 25 years left at 3.51%, but if you refinance, you'll have 30 years of payments (more total payments, but lower monthly). To compare equally, calculate the present value of 300 old monthly payments vs. the present value of 360 new payments, both discounted at some rate. A standard way is to use the OLD rate (3.51%) for discounting.\n\n#### Discounting Future Payments to Today\n\nMonthly discount rate = 3.51%/12 = 0.002925\n\nPresent value of remaining old payments:\n\nPV_old = 1326 \u00d7 [1 - (1 + 0.002925)^-300] / 0.002925\n= 1326 \u00d7 [1 - (1/2.456)] / 0.002925\n1/2.456 \u2248 0.407  \nSo, 1 - 0.407 = 0.593  \n= 1326 \u00d7 0.593 / 0.002925 \u2248 1326 \u00d7 202.6 = 268714\n\nPresent value of new loan payments:\n\nPV_new = 1148 \u00d7 [1 - (1 + 0.002925)^-360] / 0.002925\n(1 + 0.002925)^-360 \u2248 1/2.956 \u2248 0.338\n1 - 0.338 = 0.662\n\n= 1148 \u00d7 0.662 / 0.002925 \u2248 1148 \u00d7 226.3 \u2248 259798\n\nThen add the out-of-pocket cost:\n\nTotal cost to refinance (present value): 259798 + 8418 = 268216\n\n### 4. Net Savings\n\nNet savings vs. keeping old loan = PV_new_total - PV_old\n\n= 268216 - 268714 = -498\n\nSo, you save **498**, but since the question asks for \"loss as a negative number\", the answer is @@@-498@@@. \n\n#### Final Answer\n\nYou would lose @@@-498@@@ over the term of the loan, discounted to today, by refinancing.

Calculate Refinance Costs\n\n- Penalty: 2% of $269,164 = $5,383.28\n- Fees: $3,000\n- Total out-of-pocket costs = $5,383.28 + $3,000 = $8,383.28\n\n### 4. New Mortgage Details\n\n- New principal: $269,164 (the remaining balance)\n- Rate: 2.99%\n- Term: 30 years (360 months)\n\nMonthly payment:\n\n\\[\nr' = 0.0299/12 = 0.0024917\n\\]\n\\[\nP' = \\frac{0.0024917 \\cdot 269164}{1 - (1 + 0.0024917)^{-360}}\n\\]\n\\[\n(1.0024917)^{360} \\approx 2.454\n\\Rightarrow (1.0024917)^{-360} \\approx 1 / 2.454 \\approx 0.4074\n\\]\n\\[\n1 - 0.4074 = 0.5926\n\\]\n\\[\n0.0024917 \\cdot 269164 = 670.24\n\\]\n\\[\nP' = 670.24 / 0.5926 = 1131.33\n\\]\n\nSo, new monthly payment is about $1,131.33.\n\n### 5.

Calculate Savings\n\nDifference in total cost over the term (remaining in old loan vs. new):\n\n\\[\nSavings = 402390 - 415662.28 = -13272.28\n\\]\n\nSo refinancing actually costs you about $13,272.28 more over the life of the loan, when including all time-discounted payments as if paid today.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nSo the loss is:\n\n@@@-13272.28@@@\n\n---\n\n**Explanation:**  \nRefinancing results in a lower monthly payment but resets the 30-year clock and incurs penalty and fees. Over the full loan term, the costs outweigh the benefit, leading to a net loss (higher cost) if you refinance given today's rates and terms.",

Target payment is 156.10.\n\nFrom above:\n- 6% gives 143.30\n- 8% gives 166.60\n- Spread: 23.3 over 2 percentage points\n\nSo, the rate increase needed: (156.10 - 143.30) = 12.8\n\n\\( \\frac{12.8}{23.3} = 0.55 \\)\n\nAdd 0.55 \\(\\times\\) 2% = 1.1% to 6% = 7.1%\n\nSo let's try 7.1% (monthly = 0.0059167):\n\n\\( (1+0.0059167)^{240} = e^{240 \\times \\ln(1.0059167)} \\)\n\\( \\ln(1.0059167) = 0.005899 \\)\n\\( 240 \\times 0.005899 = 1.41576 \\)\n\\( e^{1.41576} = 4.119 \\)\n\nNumerator: \\( 0.0059167 \\times 4.119 = 0.024398 \\)\nDenominator: \\( 4.119 - 1 = 3.119 \\)\n\n\\( \\text{PMT} = 20000 \\times \\frac{0.024398}{3.119} = 20000 \\times 0.007825 = 156.50 \\)\n\nThis is almost exactly our target!\n\nSo, the annual rate is about 7.1%. To the nearest tenth it's 7.1.\n\nSo, the incremental rate you'd need to charge on the additional 20000 to match the increased monthly payment is:\n\n@@@7.1@@@\n\n**Summary of Approach:**  \n- Calculated the monthly payments before and after the change in balance/rate\n- Found the difference in the monthly payment\n- Solved for the rate on a 20000 loan over 20 years that results in the same additional payment\n- Used interpolation and adjusted for precision\n\nIf you need it to more decimal places, it's ~7.08%.

    "question": "For a loan of $400,000 with 3.85% interest over 25 years, with monthly payments that pay off the loan completely, how much of the 60th payment goes toward interest?",
    "expected_answer": 1117.95,
    "ai_response": "To find out how much of the 60th payment goes toward interest on a $400,000 mortgage at 3.85% annual interest (compounded monthly) over 25 years, let's break down the steps.\n\n### Step 1: Find the Monthly Payment\n\n- Loan amount (principal), P = 400,000\n- Annual interest rate = 3.85%\n- Monthly interest rate, r = 3.85% / 12 = 0.3208333% = 0.003208333\n- Number of months (n) = 25 x 12 = 300\n\nThe formula for monthly payment (M) is:\n\nM = P * r * (1 + r)^n / [(1 + r)^n \u2013 1]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nM = 400000 * 0.003208333 * (1 + 0.003208333)^300 / [(1 + 0.003208333)^300 \u2013 1]\n\nFirst, calculate (1 + r)^n:\n(1 + 0.003208333)^300 \u2248 2.62983\n\nNow, plug it all in:\n- Numerator: 400000 * 0.003208333 * 2.62983 \u2248 3374.48\n- Denominator: 2.62983 \u2013 1 = 1.62983\n\nM = 3374.48 / 1.62983 \u2248 2071.11\n\n### Step 2: Find Outstanding Principal After 59 Payments\n\nThe remaining balance after k payments is:\n\nB = P * [(1 + r)^n \u2013 (1 + r)^k] / [(1 + r)^n \u2013 1]\n\nk = 59 (since 60th payment is after 59 payments)\n\nB = 400000 * [2.62983 \u2013 (1 + 0.003208333)^59] / 1.62983\n\nCalculate (1 + r)^59:\n(1 + 0.003208333)^59 \u2248 1.21224\n\nB = 400000 * (2.62983 \u2013 1.21224) / 1.62983\nB = 400000 * 1.41759 / 1.62983\nB = 566,836 / 1.62983 \u2248 347,870\n\nWait, this seems off. Let's double-check this calculation:\n\n- 2.62983 \u2013 1.21224 = 1.41759\n- 400000 * 1.41759 = 567,036\n- 567,036 / 1.62983 \u2248 347,968.6\n\nSo, the outstanding principal after 59 payments is about 347,968.6.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Interest in 60th Payment\n\nMonthly interest: current balance * monthly rate\n\nInterest portion = Outstanding balance * r\nInterest portion = 347,968.6 * 0.003208333 \u2248 1,116.08\n\nSo, the amount of the 60th payment that goes toward interest is @@@1116.08@@@.\n\n### Double Check\n\nRounding per the instructions is often to the nearest cent. But the logic here is correct:\n\n1. Calculate the monthly payment.\n2. Calculate the remaining balance after 59 payments.\n3. Multiply that balance by the monthly interest rate to get the interest portion of the 60th payment.\n\nSo, the correct answer is @@@1116.08@@@.",
